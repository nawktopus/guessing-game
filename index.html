    <h1>About Me</h1> 
    <p id="bio">Hi, I'm Jordan Kwan! I reside in the Bay Area, in California. I have two wonderful pets, Yuda, my rambunctious little Corgi and Mocha, food monger Calico. 
      <br>I love to go bike riding, taking photos, reading books and working on my car. I've lived here most of my life and love the weather and everything that it has to offer.
    </p>
  
    <p id="edu">The highest level of education that I currently hold is an Associates Degree from Community College. I am eager to continue my education through Code Fellows
      even further with a Bachelors. I feel in a better spot of continual education and that it can help rather than hinder anymore opportunities. I can't wait to see what the 
      world has in store for me.
    </p>

    <p id="workExp">I have many years of experience in the retail world. I've worked on the floor, as a cashier, in the back and with receiving shipments. Along with that I
      have experience working with machine learning with the automotive space. Two very different kind of lines of work, but I am grateful for it all. I have the customer service
      experience as well the technical to help boost my software developer career. 
    </p>

    <p id="goals">My goals for the future are to have a home to call my own, to travel and to help change the lives of anyone and everyone that I meet. I want to be able to purchase 
      and work on the car of my dreams, a 1999 Nissan Skyline GTR. I would love to also expand my photography and shoot more film. Just to be able to do all the things I've always put 
      to the side because of time and/or money. But I have hopes that I can do so one day.
    </p>

    <p id="end">Thank you for reading this far and I hope you have a better understanding of who I am! - Jordan
