    <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p id="bio">Hi, I'm Jordan Kwan! I reside in the Bay Area, in California. I have two wonderful pets, Yuda, my rambunctious little Corgi and Mocha, food monger Calico. 
      I love to go bike riding and taking photos. I've lived here most of my life and love the weather and everything that it has to offer.</p>
